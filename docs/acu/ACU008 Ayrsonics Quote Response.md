# CBC Sports Desk – Response to Ayrsonics Quote Q12835

## 1. Engagement Context
- Studio 8 measurements indicate persistent low-frequency modal peaks at 125 Hz/315 Hz, destructive nulls at 400 Hz and 1.25 kHz, and “poor to fair” speech intelligibility in all but the Host A position; corner and ceiling locations remain the least controlled (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:13-105).
- The treatment roadmap prioritizes floor-to-ceiling broadband absorption in every corner (4-6 inch mineral wool), tuned modal control for 125 Hz, mid-band diffusion, and a ceiling cloud array over the desk (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:129-150).
- Raw STI/C50/RT60 deltas confirm 25-34 % speech-transmission degradation and 65-100 % clarity loss at Host C, both NE corners, SE/SW corners, and the over-desk ceiling, establishing high-urgency remediation targets (data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Evidence_Degradation_Analysis.csv:2-8).
- The treatment priority matrix prescribes 4-6 panels of ≥3 inch wall absorption at Host C, 4-6 panels of 5.5 inch bass traps at every corner, and 3 inch ceiling clouds above the desk before any aesthetic upgrades (data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Treatment_Priority_Matrix.csv:2-8).
- Ayrsonics had the full measurement package when preparing Quote Q12835, so the omission of low-frequency, corner, and ceiling solutions reflects a scope misalignment despite their access to our data set.

## 2. Summary of Ayrsonics Quote SQ012835
- Scope: two decorative “Rubik Feature” walls made of 1.5 inch PET tiles (9 mm face + 12 mm backer) and companion 25 mm (≈1 inch) EzoCore sheets double-taped behind each feature wall; additional 25 mm EzoCore sheets cut into long horizontal bands, plus industrial tape and third-party install labor (docs/Ayrsonics - CBC- Sports Desk - Q12835.pdf:1-3).
- No line items reference bass traps, broadband corner columns, ceiling clouds, diffusion, or tuned absorbers; all materials are thin PET systems optimized for mid/high-frequency NRC and aesthetics.

## 3. Alignment Assessment
- **Low-frequency control deficit:** Measurements show the modal problems sit at 100-400 Hz, requiring ≥4 inch thickness and air gaps to achieve meaningful absorption, yet the quote tops out at 1-1.5 inch bonded PET—insufficient for the targeted bands (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:30-115; data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Treatment_Priority_Matrix.csv:3-7).
- **Corner remediation ignored:** Every highest-urgency location is a corner (NE high/low, SE, SW), but the proposal only treats two flat wall features and some horizontal strips, leaving the modal hot spots untouched (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:67-105; data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Evidence_Degradation_Analysis.csv:2,5-7).
- **Ceiling cloud omission:** RT60/C50 degradation above the desk is ≥80 % yet no ceiling system is included, contradicting Priority 4 in our report (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:145-148; data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Evidence_Degradation_Analysis.csv:8).
- **Host position needs unmet:** Host C (critical on-air seat) needs 3 inch broadband panels plus modal control to recover STI—thin Rubik tiles will not correct the 25.3 % STI loss and 67 % Alcons rise recorded there (data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Evidence_Degradation_Analysis.csv:3; data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Treatment_Priority_Matrix.csv:2).
- **Diffusion and placement strategy absent:** Recommendation for mid-band diffusion on the rear wall and host-position optimization is entirely missing, so comb-filtering artifacts (1-4 kHz nulls) will persist (docs/250728-Studio8-Comprehensive_Acoustic_Analysis_Report.md:140-153).
- **Attachment methodology:** Reliance on double-sided tape for all 25 mm sheets offers limited mass coupling; our data call for mechanically fastened traps to manage vibration energy, not taped PET layers.
- **Balance risk:** Applying thin PET layers where mids/highs are already better controlled would damp those frequencies first, leaving the problematic low-frequency modes even more dominant and perceptually imbalanced.

## 4. Conclusion
The Ayrsonics package focuses on decorative acoustic elements, not the technical mitigation plan required by the measurement set. As scoped, it misses every high-priority requirement (corner LF absorption, ceiling clouds, modal tuning, diffusion, host-seat correction) and risks worsening the perceived balance by removing only higher-frequency content. It therefore does not close the acoustic gaps documented in our data.

## 5. Recommended Response / Next Steps
1. Request a revised scope that directly addresses the documented LF modal, STI, and clarity requirements by bundling 4-6 inch corner traps, ceiling clouds, Host C broadband kits, and rear-wall diffusion per our July 28 analysis.
2. Re-share the priority matrix CSV so the vendor can size the correct number and thickness of panels explicitly against each high-urgency position (data/measurements/250728-Studio8-Treatment_Priority_Matrix.csv:2-8).
3. If Ayrsonics cannot provide tuned LF solutions, invite alternative suppliers or an engineering-led redesign before committing ~$17k to aesthetic surfaces that leave the broadcast desk non-compliant.

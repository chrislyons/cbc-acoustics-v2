# Sprint 4: Interactive Features & Polish

**Sprint Goal:** Add comparison mode, mobile UX, accessibility, and deploy to production  
**Prerequisites:** ACU004 complete (core visualizations working)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days  
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

- Accessibility audit and fixes (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Export functionality (PNG, PDF, data)
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment (Cloudflare Pages or Vercel)

---

## Objectives

- [ ] Implement comparison mode UI
- [ ] Optimize mobile touch interactions

## Implementation Notes

*(Full detailed implementation notes will be added when Sprint 4 begins)*

### Key Features

1. **Comparison Mode**
   - Split-screen layout (before | after)
   - Synchronized camera controls in 3D view
   - Overlay frequency curves
   - Diff view for metrics

2. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - Touch gestures for 3D (pinch-zoom, two-finger rotate)
   - Collapsible panels for small screens
   - Bottom sheet controls (mobile-friendly)
   - Simplified heatmap for mobile

3. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation for all controls
   - ARIA labels on interactive elements
   - Focus indicators visible
   - Color contrast >4.5:1
   - Screen reader announcements for metric updates

4. **Export**
   - PNG export for charts (Recharts built-in)
   - 3D view screenshot (canvas.toDataURL)
   - CSV export for raw data
   - PDF report generation (optional)

5. **Deployment**
   - Cloudflare Pages (recommended for Chris)
   - Environment variables for config
   - Analytics setup (optional)
   - Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
